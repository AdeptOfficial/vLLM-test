# Qwen 2.5-14B AWQ Benchmark on vLLM

This document summarizes the benchmarking of **Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-AWQ** served via **vLLM** on a single GPU. The benchmark measures throughput and latency under increasing concurrency, providing a baseline for production deployment.

---

## 🖥️ Test Environment

* **Model:** Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-AWQ (AWQ quantization)
* **vLLM Version:** 0.13.0
* **GPU:** [Your GPU Model], 32GB VRAM
* **CUDA:** 11.x
* **OS:** Linux
* **Server Config:**

  * Max model length: 4096 tokens
  * Chunked prefill: 2048 tokens
  * Prefix caching: Enabled
  * Single GPU
* **Client:** Async Python script using `openai` compatible API

---

## 🧪 Benchmark Methodology

1. The vLLM API server was started locally on port `8001`.
2. The following test prompt was used for each request:

```text
Write a short paragraph explaining why GPUs are good for AI.
```

* Prompt tokens: 11
* Max tokens per response: 200

3. Concurrency was varied to simulate multiple simultaneous requests:

```
40, 60, 80
```

4. Metrics recorded per concurrency:

* Total time for all requests
* Average latency per request
* Requests per second
* Tokens per second

5. Results were saved to a timestamped `.txt` file for reproducibility.

## 📊 Benchmark Results

| Concurrency | Total Time (s) | Avg Latency (s) | Requests/sec | Tokens/sec |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 40          | 3.39           | 2.46            | 11.81        | 1,467.89   |
| 60          | 2.99           | 2.05            | 20.09        | 2,529.38   |
| 80          | 4.14           | 2.48            | 19.34        | 2,427.98   |

## 🔍 Analysis

1. **Optimal concurrency:**

   * Peak throughput occurs at **60 concurrent requests**.
   * Beyond 60, throughput slightly decreases due to GPU saturation and queuing.

2. **Latency trends:**

   * Average latency increases at higher concurrency (40 → 80)
   * This is expected in a GPU-bound scenario with chunked prefill.

3. **GPU utilization:**

   * Prefix cache hit rate stabilized at ~77%
   * KV cache usage remained low (~1–2%), indicating no memory pressure

4. **Stability:**

   * Server handled all requests without errors or OOM
   * Throughput scales predictably until saturation

---

## ⚡ Key Takeaways

* **Concurrency sweet spot:** ~60 requests per GPU
* **Sustained throughput:** ~2,500 tokens/sec at optimal concurrency
* **Latency:** ~2s per request at saturation, lower at moderate concurrency
* **Production readiness:** This setup is stable for serving AWQ 14B in a single-GPU scenario.

---

## 🛠️ Recommendations

1. **Interactive usage:** Keep concurrency ≤ 40 for low-latency responses (~1–2s)
2. **Batch usage:** Push concurrency to 60 to maximize throughput
3. **Future tests:**

   * Vary prompt content to simulate real users (avoid prefix cache boost)
   * Test longer sequence lengths (max model len > 4096)
   * Compare against FP16 or other quantized formats
